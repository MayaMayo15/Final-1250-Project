                    <p><strong>What</strong> - This product is a smart multi-functional clothing rack lamp serving both daily functional and emotional needs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who</strong> - Target audience consists of individuals living alone who value home aesthetics, need low-maintenance companionship, and want a 3-in-1 clothing rack lamp pet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Where</strong> - The product is designed to be placed in intimate indoor areas. Examples include bedrooms, living rooms, study rooms, and meditation rooms</p>
                    <p><strong>Why</strong> - In today's fast-paced society, people often lack the time and energy to socialize but still seek emotional connections. This product enables that by behaving as both a functional tool and emotional companion. </p>
                    <p><strong>How</strong> - The stand of the lamp limits its movement, so it won't be intrusive to the user. The different light colors and forms of its neck provide feedback to interact with the user. The metal-wrapped neck signifies that the lamp can be twisted and morphed into different shapes, while the lamp itself signifies light. </p>

The primary audience is young adults interested in home decor. Standing at 167 cm, the body uses steel for strength. The flexible neck uses a spiral metal spring wrapped with metal tape. Polypropylene covers the light. This minimalistic design serves as both a clothing rack and mood lamp.</p>

                <p>The main intention of this product is to function as a multifunctional clothing rack lamp. It incorporates key functional elements including reduced effort, organization, integration, and sensory appeal. This product reduces the user's effort in finding a place to hang clothes and organizes the environment by serving as a designated clothing rack. Its smart technology element also minimizes disruption by waking users with gentle light instead of an abrupt alarm. Additionally, it integrates multiple product functionalities into one device, making it highly cost-effective and convenient. With its aesthetically pleasing and stylish design, it also delivers strong visual appeal.</p>

Owning a stylish product is not only visually pleasing but also elevates self-confidence by serving as a symbol of good taste. Beyond visual appeal, the smart functionalities of this product—such as light alarms and emotional interactions through its adjustable neck—enable emotional values including therapeutic benefits, fun and entertainment, and anxiety reduction. Since the product functions not only as a practical tool but also as an emotional companion in the user's home, it reduces anxiety by alleviating loneliness, adds playful interactivity through engagement with the product's "life," and improves mental wellbeing.</p>

                <p>What truly sets this product apart from other lamps or clothing hangers are its values of affiliation and motivation. In a not-so-distant imaginative future, our home furniture may all be smart, multifunctional, and aesthetically pleasing. Owning this product would then create a sense of belonging to a community of people who recognize or own this product—similar to the connection among owners of pets of the same species. At the same time, the way this product is personified and brought to "life" can also motivate users in different ways. Seeing the mood lamp display a sad expression could potentially motivate the user to take action and improve their current situation, or it can simply serve as an emotional supporter that accompanies the user through their day.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="prototype-content">
                <p>Prototype 1 is a very basic and simple prototype of the lamp’s overall form. It has a round base, a flexible neck, and a round light. This prototype was able to represent a very sketchy version of the product's design, however I couldn’t reflect its actual form as the paper neck was too soft and wobbly. </p>
                <p>To create this prototype, I started by drawing and cutting two large circles and two smaller circles on a large piece of cardstock paper. I then measured the circumference of the two circles and cut out a paper stripe that was 2 inches wide with a length matching the circumference. After cutting fringes on both sides of the stripe, I applied glue to attach them. I repeated the same process for the lamp using the smaller circles. For the neck section, I cut out two long stripes of the cardstock and folded them on top of each other to create a spring-like material that would allow flexibility.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="prototype-content">
                <p>The key development in Prototype 2 focused on improving the neck structure so the lamp could stand independently and better showcase the product's form. I also revised the lamp head design from flat to rounded, which created a more aesthetically pleasing appearance and allowed for a larger light projection.</p>
                <p>To create a structured neck that could be twisted into different shapes, I repeated the origami folding process, then separated the two stripes and used an awl to pierce a hole in the center of each folded square. Once all the holes were made, I threaded an aluminum wire through them and connected it to the lamp's base and head for stability.</p>
                <p>For the rounded lamp surface, I followed a similar process to Prototype 1, but this time created a ring instead of a solid circle. I cut another circle of the same size and made vertical, horizontal, and diagonal cuts halfway to the center. After cutting, I bent the circle to fit securely inside the ring.</p>

                <p>The third prototype refined the lamp section while maintaining the rounded design from Prototype 2. To better showcase the lamp's soft, blurred lighting effect, I switched from cardstock to baking paper, which allowed light to pass through. Testing with my phone's torch demonstrated a significant improvement—the translucent material revealed how the lamp would appear in actual use.</p>
                <p>For the final prototype, I created a simple app mockup with two screens showcasing the product's key digital features: alarm settings and remote lamp control. After Bluetooth pairing, users can set automatic lighting times and adjust brightness through a slider interface instead of traditional ringtones.</p>
                <p>The second screen allows manual neck adjustment through the app. This interactive experience allows users to toggle, set, and name different neck forms. Users can save multiple designs and simply tap preset moods like "curious" or "happy" to instantly reshape their lamp.</p>

            <p>I am designing a smart multifunctional clothing rack lamp that serves as both a functional storage solution, holding up to three coats or jackets, and an emotional companion. This fictional object provides mood lighting through customizable colors via an app, automatic morning alarms with bright light, and a flexible neck that moves to express emotions like happiness, sadness, or curiosity, mimicking a pet or friend.</p>
            
            <p>I am designing for individuals who value home aesthetics and seek low-maintenance companionship. The product is intended for private indoor spaces, specifically bedrooms or living rooms, where users interact with it everyday individually to foster personal connection and feel special.</p>
            
            <p>The flexible neck embodies Don Norman's visibility principle, making lighting adjustments intuitive and discoverable. A clicking switch provides clear feedback, while neck length constraints ensure physical stability. The familiar switch design and metal-wrapped neck offer strong affordances, initiating naturally intuitive interactions from first encounter.</p>
            
            <p>This object reflects society's growing desire for technology that offers emotional support alongside functionality, suggesting a future where everyday objects become companions that respond to our moods and enhance well-being through thoughtful, human-centered design.</p>
